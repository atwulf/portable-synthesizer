  <!--
    you know what would be cool here? having the ability to
    bind arbitrary keys to arbitrary notes/sound names on screen
    like:
    [KeyA] => [snare]
    where left box listens for keyup and prints the keycode,
    right box takes arbitrary input, and on change those are
    remapped or whatever. that would be helpful.
