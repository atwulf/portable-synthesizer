## `portable-synthesizer`
### *making sounds with javascript*

this is nothing yet! come watch me make it into *something* live on [my twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/atwulf) sundays at 3pm est

#### what i did on the last stream
- added an `Oscillator` class to manage oscillators
- implemented `Synthesizer#play` and `Synthesizer#stop` to take into account `Synthesizer#setTone` calls
- started to create "testing ground" page for demoing the synth

#### what i did before this stream
- nothing yet, the stream just wrapped! [watch the vod](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/305071577)

#### what i'm doing on this stream
- finishing up the basic keymapping stuff for the "testing ground"
- implementing noises (counterpart to oscillators)
- adding some tests
